# PLPBasicGitAssignment
i had a Github account ready and also installed Git
i logged in to my account and created the repository
In the terminal i cloned it with < git clone> to mydesired path on my matchine
I then navigated to the repository path using <cd path > and initialized it with <git init>
inside my repository i created my folder using < mkdir name>
i used < touch hello.txt> to create the file and used nano <hello.txt> to write contents in it
i staged the changes using <git add hello.txt> and commited the changes using < git commit -m "..."> and pushing it to github using <git push -u origin main>
